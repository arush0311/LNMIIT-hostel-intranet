<h2><div align="center" color=#8B0000>WELCOME TO DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS</div></h2><br>
<div style="margin-left:400px">
Mathematics is primarily concerned with logical deduction and<br> abstraction. The logical deduction aspect helps to think<br> systematically and argue in an irrefutable manner. The abstraction<br> aspect, on the other hand, helps to identify the absolutely essential<br> issues and the inter-relations among them. Both these aspects,<br> logical deduction and abstraction, play an important role in<br> Information Technology also.<br><br>
<p>Therefore first objective of the department of Mathematics is to<br> produce the students with high mathematical thinking in tune with<br> the latest development in information technology. Now a days<br> Mathematics is an integral part in the study of many area such as<br> computer science, communication, cyber security, bio-mechanics<br> and finance etc. Department of Mathematics is also focused to<br> motivate the students towards research and to make aware them<br> importance and increasing needs of mathematics in various areas<br> of science and technology. To achieve these goals, the department<br> maintains the high standard of teaching and research. All faculty<br> members of the department are well qualified with rich academic<br> and research experience. All faculty members are doctorate from<br> the institutes of repute and highly engaged in research in diverse<br> area of basic sciences, engineering and technology. To make<br> aware of the latest developments, the department keeps on timely<br> updating in its teaching and research methodology and introduces<br> new courses, which are aligned with the need to tackle real life<br> challenging problems in science and technology.</p>
<p>Faculty members of the department are actively associated and<br> contributed to various learned societies like Society of Industrial<br> and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) USA, Indian Society of Industrial<br> and Applied Mathematics (ISIAM), Indian Mathematical Society<br> (IMS), Ramanujan Mathematical Society (RMS)</p>
