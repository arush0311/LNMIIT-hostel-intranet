<h3><div align="center" color=#8B0000>Welcome to Department of PHYSICS</h3><br><br><br>
<b style="margin-left:400px">Welcome to Department of Physics</b><br>
<div style="margin-left:390">
<p style="margin-left:400px">The Physics Department at LNMIIT is small but cohesive and<br> driven towards excellence. Each Faculty Member in the<br> Department has been chosen for their exceptional abilities and this<br> is the primary reason for our success.</p><br></div>
<p style="margin-left:400px">We have built clusters of excellence in the areas of Condensed<br> Matter Physics (including Nanotechnology and Materials Science)<br> and High Energy Physics and Cosmology. We are building up<br> capabilities in computational physics. This will enable us to capture<br> synergies with other departments in the Institute â€“ for example the<br> mathematics Department has a strength in the area of numerical<br> solution of partial differential equations and we regularly interact<br> with them on building up the computational expertise at the<br> Institute.</p><br>
<p style="margin-left:400px">We have also recently been given the green light to pursue the<br> building up of high end computational power which will enable the<br> Institute to take a lead in this area. The Institute is also planning to<br> establish a Center of Excellence in the area of Nanotechnology<br> and Material Science. Thus, the Physics Department is well poised<br> to build on its strengths and deepen its pursuit of excellence.</p><br>
